          <h3>Sapient Industries provide analytics for smart buildings</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Our integrated platform applies machine learning and analytics to
            facility electrical data, delivering deep insights that drive cost,
            carbon, and operational efficiencies. Our customers capitalize on
            next-level building intelligence to harmonize and execute energy,
            facilities, sustainability, and real estate initiatives.
          </p>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Our solution supports stakeholders across facilities management,
            energy, real estate, sustainability, asset management, IT, and
            finance. Our platform’s analytics drive immediate impact and
            intuitively enable data-driven decision-making by providing users
            with actionable insights at every node of a building’s energy
            consumption.

          <h3>Why we use QuestDB for real-time analytics</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            QuestDB facilitates actionable performance because of the speed for
            complex queries. Data can be pulled in real-time without having to
            store it. One major draw for us was that QuestDB uses SQL; this
            eliminated the learning curve for our team. We don’t have to learn a
            new custom query language and we can easily compose common queries
            as we go with our existing familiarity with SQL.
          </p>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            We’re capturing minute-level energy usage data from electrical
            equipment throughout facilities. These devices and pieces of
            equipment range from IT gear like laptops and workstations, to
            industrial machinery, lighting, facility equipment, refrigerators,
            and all other energy-consuming equipment.
          </p>

          <p className="font-size--large">
            Upon collecting electrical consumption data from the thousands of
            pieces of equipment in a building, we use machine learning
            algorithms to automatically label each device throughout the
            facility. We then employ a collection of ‘device-utilization’
            queries to check for abnormalities such as sudden amperage
            increases, deliver energy usage comparisons over time and geography,
            provide emissions calculations, among countless other metrics.
          </p>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            When customers have a detailed breakdown of the equipment-specific
            energy consumption in their facilities, they can make data-driven
            decisions that have broad-reaching benefits across the organization.
            Insights driven by the detection of energy usage spikes, abnormally
            high energy density, or irregularities in current draw drive
            efficiencies across maintenance, space reconfiguration, procurement
            decisions, sustainability investments and more.
          </p>
          <h3>Our analytics platform is cloud-native and highly available </h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            For our deployment, QuestDB is configured as a StatefulSet in a
            Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform. We deploy two instances
            on different node-pools and route traffic to both for High
            Availability. We back up partitions hourly to Google Cloud Storage
            using custom Go programs that we developed.
          </p>

          <p className="font-size--large">
            Our deployment’s API queries QuestDB over REST API, and we’re
            ingesting data using InfluxDB Line Protocol for high throughput. For
            the data requirements, we’re typically ingesting 250GB worth of
            sensor data into QuestDB per month, and we currently have about
            1.2TB in an instance.
